> It's still 🚧 work in progress but currently very 🐎 stable 😉  
> *I mean at least for my device as I'm not able to* 🧪 *test it for any other so any* 🧍 *volunteers?* 😊  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Inspired by [StephanJoubert/home_assistant_solarman](https://github.com/StephanJoubert/home_assistant_solarman) but w/ a lot of [✍ crucial changes & new features](https://github.com/davidrapan/ha-solarman/wiki#-changes)  
> Implemented using asynchronous [pysolarmanv5](https://github.com/jmccrohan/pysolarmanv5) and fetching through DataUpdateCoordinator + incorporates many more fixes and improvements and also up to date features of HA (while trying to fully preserve backward compatibility)

> [!WARNING]  
> It's not possible to use this integration side by side (with the same device) with the implementation from Stephan! It will override it.
